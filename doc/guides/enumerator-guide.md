### Submission Status Indicators

- **Draft** (Gray): Work in progress, not yet submitted
- **Submitted** (Blue): Sent for review, awaiting admin decision

- **Rejected** (Red): Returned for corrections, you can edit and resubmit

## Filling Out Questionnaires

### Starting a New Submission

1. Navigate to **Questionnaires**
2. Browse the list of available questionnaires
3. Click **Fill Out** on the questionnaire you want to complete
4. The survey form will open

### Understanding the Survey Form

The survey forms are built with SurveyJS and include:

- **Pages**: Surveys may have multiple pages (use Next/Previous buttons)
- **Required fields**: Marked with a red asterisk (*)
- **Question types**:
  - Text inputs: Free text entry
  - Numbers: Numeric values only
  - Dropdowns: Select one option
  - Checkboxes: Select multiple options
  - Radio buttons: Select one option from several
  - Date pickers: Select dates
  - Text areas: Longer text responses

### Required vs Optional Fields

- **Required fields** must be filled before you can submit
- The system will show an error if you try to save/submit without completing required fields
- Optional fields can be left blank if not applicable

### Validation Rules

Some fields have validation rules:
- **Email fields**: Must be valid email format
- **Number fields**: Must be numeric
- **Date fields**: Must be valid dates
- **Min/Max values**: Numbers must be within specified range
- **Pattern matching**: Text must match a specific format

If you enter invalid data, the form will show an error message explaining what's wrong.

### Conditional Logic

Some questions may appear or hide based on your previous answers:
- Answer truthfully and completely
- If a question disappears, it means it's not applicable based on your previous answer
- If a new question appears, fill it out as required

### Auto-Save

The system does not auto-save. You must manually save your work using the **Save Draft** button.

## Managing Your Submissions

### Saving as Draft

To save your work without submitting:

1. Fill out the questionnaire (as much as you can)
2. Click **Save Draft** at the bottom of the form
3. You'll be redirected to your submissions list
4. The submission status will be "Draft"

Benefits of saving drafts:
- Continue work later
- Prevent data loss
- Complete complex surveys over multiple sessions
- Gather required information before submitting

### Editing a Draft

To continue working on a draft:

1. Navigate to **Submissions**
2. Filter by **Status: Draft** (optional)
3. Find your draft submission
4. Click **Edit**
5. Continue filling out the form
6. Click **Save Draft** again or **Submit** when complete

### Submitting for Review

When your questionnaire is complete and accurate:

1. Open the draft submission (or fill out a new questionnaire)
2. Review all your answers carefully
3. Ensure all required fields are filled
4. Click **Submit for Review**
5. Confirm the submission

What happens after submission:
- Status changes to "Submitted"
- You can no longer edit it
- An administrator will review it
- You'll be notified of approval or rejection

### Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] All required fields are completed
- [ ] Numbers and dates are accurate
- [ ] Text responses are clear and complete
- [ ] No typos or obvious errors

## Working with Drafts

### When to Use Drafts

Use drafts when:
- You need to gather more information
- You're interrupted and need to continue later
- The survey is long and requires multiple sessions
- You want to verify data before final submission
- You need supervisor review before submitting

### Managing Multiple Drafts

Tips for organizing drafts:
- Use descriptive titles if available
- Note the questionnaire name
- Track which drafts are priority
- Complete oldest drafts first
- Don't accumulate too many drafts
- Set reminders to complete drafts

### Draft Limitations

- Drafts are only visible to you and administrators
- Drafts don't appear in reports
- Old drafts may become invalid if the questionnaire is updated
- No notifications are sent for drafts

## Handling Rejections

### Understanding Rejections

An administrator may reject your submission if:
- Data is incomplete
- Information is incorrect or inconsistent
- Required documentation is missing
- Validation rules are not met
- Format doesn't match requirements

Rejection is not a criticism - it's quality control to ensure accurate data.

### When a Submission is Rejected

You will see:
- Status changed to "Rejected" (red)
- Rejection date and time
- Administrator's comments explaining what needs correction
- Option to edit and resubmit

### Reading Rejection Comments

Rejection comments tell you what to fix:
- Read them carefully
- Take notes if needed
- Gather correct information before editing
- Contact the administrator if comments are unclear

### Editing and Resubmitting

To fix a rejected submission:

1. Navigate to **Submissions**
2. Filter by **Status: Rejected**
3. Find the rejected submission
4. Read the rejection comments carefully
5. Click **Edit**
6. Make the required corrections
   - Look for highlighted fields (if implemented)
   - Refer to rejection comments
   - Verify all data
7. Click **Submit for Review** again

The submission will return to "Submitted" status for another review.

### Multiple Rejections

If your submission is rejected multiple times:
- Review rejection comments more carefully
- Verify you understand the requirements
- Contact your supervisor or the administrator
- Ask for clarification on specific fields
- Request training if needed

## Tips and Best Practices

### Before Starting a Survey
